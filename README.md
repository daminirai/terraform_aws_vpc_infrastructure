**"Setting up Infrastructure on AWS using Terraform"**
Created AWS infrastructure along with multiple AWS services like VPC, subnets, S3 buckets and loadbalancer
1. Added load balancer to manage the requests 
2. Understanding the structure of terraform resources
3. Automate the deployment of AWS infrastructre 
# Project Overview
Here’s what I built using Terraform:

1.VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

2.Public Subnets (Subnet1, Subnet2)

3.Internet Gateway for connectivity

4.Route Table and Subnet Association for network routing

5.EC2 Instances (Server 1 & Server 2)

6.Target Group for load balancing

7.Security Group for secure access

8.S3 Bucket for storage

9.Objects in the S3 Bucket

10.Accessing the application through the public site

** During this project, I faced several challenges, including:**
 1️⃣ Setting up IAM Roles for S3 access.
 2️⃣ Resolving errors while making the S3 bucket public using bucket policies and ACLs.
 3️⃣ Troubleshooting ownership control issues while uploading objects to the S3 bucket.
